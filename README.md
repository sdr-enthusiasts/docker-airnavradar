Docker container running [AirNav RadarBox](https://www.radarbox.com)'s `rbfeeder`. Designed to work in tandem with [sdr-enthusiasts/readsb-protobuf](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf). Builds and runs on `x86_64`, `arm64` and `arm32v7`.

`rbfeeder` pulls ModeS/BEAST information from a host or container providing ModeS/BEAST data, and sends data to RadarBox.

For more information on what `rbfeeder` is, see here: [sharing-data](https://www.radarbox.com/sharing-data).

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` (`main` branch, `Dockerfile`)
* `latest_nohealthcheck` is the same as the `latest` version above. However, this version has the docker healthcheck removed. This is done for people running platforms (such as [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io)) that don't support manually disabling healthchecks, where healthchecks are not wanted.
* Version and architecture specific tags available

## Multi Architecture Support

Currently, this image should pull and run on the following architectures:

* `amd64`: Linux x86-64
* `arm32v7`, `armv7l`: ARMv7 32-bit (Odroid HC1/HC2/XU4, RPi 2/3)
* `arm64`, `aarch64`: ARMv8 64-bit (RPi 4 64-bit OSes)

## Obtaining a RadarBox Sharing Key

First-time users should obtain a RadarBox sharing key.

In order to obtain a RadarBox sharing key, on the first run of the container, `rbfeeder` will generate a sharing key and print this to the container log.

```shell
timeout 300s docker run \
    --rm \
    -it \
    -e BEASTHOST=YOURBEASTHOST \
    -e LAT=YOURLATITUDE \
    -e LONG=YOURLONGITUDE \
    -e ALT=YOURALTITUDE \
    ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox:latest
```

This will run the container for five minutes, allowing a sharing key to be generated.

You should obviously replace `YOURBEASTHOST`, `YOURLATITUDE`, `YOURLONGITUDE` and `YOURALTITUDE` with appropriate values.

Shortly after the container launches, you should be presented with:

```
[2020-04-02 11:36:31]  Empty sharing key. We will try to create a new one for you!
[2020-04-02 11:36:32]  Your new key is g45643ab345af3c5d5g923a99ffc0de9. Please save this key for future use. You will have to know this key to link this receiver to your account in RadarBox24.com. This key is also saved in configuration file (/etc/rbfeeder.ini)
```

Take a note of the sharing key, as you'll need it when launching the container.

If you're not a first time user and are migrating from another installation, you can retrieve your sharing key using either of the following methods:

* SSH onto your existing receiver and run the command `rbfeeder --showkey --no-start`
* SSH onto your existing receiver and run the command `grep key= /etc/rbfeeder.ini`

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name rbfeeder \
 -e TZ="YOURTIMEZONE" \
 -e BEASTHOST=YOURBEASTHOST \
 -e LAT=YOURLATITUDE \
 -e LONG=YOURLONGITUDE \
 -e ALT=YOURALTITUDE \
 -e SHARING_KEY=YOURSHARINGKEY \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox:latest
```

You should obviously replace `YOURBEASTHOST`, `YOURLATITUDE`, `YOURLONGITUDE`, `YOURALTITUDE` and `YOURSHARINGKEY` with appropriate values.

For example:

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name rbfeeder \
 -e TZ="Australia/Perth" \
 -e BEASTHOST=readsb \
 -e LAT=-33.33333 \
 -e LONG=111.11111 \
 -e ALT=90 \
 -e SHARING_KEY=g45643ab345af3c5d5g923a99ffc0de9 \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox:latest
```

Please note, the altitude figure is given in metres and no units should be specified.

## Runtime Environment Variables

There are a series of available environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Purpose                         | Default |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| `BEASTHOST`          | Required. IP/Hostname of a Mode-S/BEAST provider (dump1090/readsb) | `readsb` |
| `BEASTPORT`          | Optional. TCP port number of Mode-S/BEAST provider (dump1090/readsb) | `30005` |
| `UAT_RECEIVER_HOST`  | Optional. IP/Hostname of an external UAT decoded JSON provider (eg: dump978-fa). | |
| `UAT_RECEIVER_PORT`  | Optional. TCP port number of the external UAT decoded JSON provider. | `30979` |
| `SHARING_KEY`        | Required. Radarbox Sharing Key | |
| `LAT` | Required. Latitude of the antenna | |
| `LONG` | Required. Longitude of the antenna | |
| `ALT` | Required. Altitude in *metres* | |
| `TZ`                 | Optional. Your local timezone | GMT     |
| `STATS_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | Optional. How often to print statistics, in minutes. | `5` |
| `VERBOSE_LOGGING` | Optional. Set to `true` for no filtering of `rbfeeder` logs. | `false` |
| `ENABLE_MLAT` | Option. Set to `true` to enable MLAT inside of the container. See [MLAT note](#mlat) below | `true` |

## Ports

The following TCP ports are used by this container:

* `32088` - `rbfeeder` listens on this port, however I can't find the use for this port...
* `30105` - `mlat-client` listens on this port to provide MLAT results.

## MLAT

You may find that MLAT in your container will often times spit out errors in your logs, such as

```shell
[rbfeeder] Disconnecting from mlat1.rb24.com:40900: No data (not even keepalives) received for 60 seconds
[rbfeeder] Connected to multilateration server at mlat1.rb24.com:40900, handshaking
```

This is likely, but not always, not caused by anything you are doing, but is instead caused by the Radarbox server itself and as such there isn't anything you can do to fix it. You will see in your Radarbox stats very little, if any, MLAT targets from your feeder while it is doing this.

To stop the feeder from spamming your logs you can set `ENABLE_MLAT=false` in your environment configuration for Radarbox and it will stop the MLAT service, and the log messages. Please note that if you do this, and you use [MLAT Hub](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf#advanced-usage-creating-an-mlat-hub) please remove Radarbox from your `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR` under `MLAT Hub`.

## Logging

* All processes are logged to the container's stdout, and can be viewed with `docker logs [-f] container`.
